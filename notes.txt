R SIM

FILE SPEC
- Each tile in the file is represented by two values.
- The first value represents the tile type
- The second is only used for input and output to reference the truth table
- A line starting with three equals signs signifys a header
- Blank lines are ignored

TILE TYPES
0: Air
- Delay+: 0
- Expense: 0
- Does nothing

1: Wire
- Delay+: 0
- Expense: 1
- No wires = auto fail
- In 2D mode
  - Same power as any wire with in left right up and down

2: Inverter
- Delay+: 1
- Expense: 1
- In 2D mode
  - Will only invert to a wire directly across from input wire
- In 3D mode
  - Powers block above
  - Powers all wires up down left right forward and behind

3: Repeater
- Delay+: 2
- Expense: 1
- Not for initial versions

4: Input
- Delay+: 0
- Expense: 0
- Sets any nearby wires to this power state according to the current truth.
- If an input does not have a wire as a neighbor, auto fail

5: Output
- Delay+: 0
- Expense: 0
- Takes in an input to compare to the current truth.
- If truth is off, then it should stay off or fail.
- If the truth is on, then it should turn on then stay on.
- If an output does not have a wire as a neighbor, auto fail

6: Block
- Delay+: 0
- Expense: 1
- Not enabled in 2D
